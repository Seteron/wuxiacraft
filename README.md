# WuxiaCraft

### A Cultivation mod for us: Minecraft heroes.

This mod aims to give the player the ability to get strong as he/she cultivates (or have a fortuitous encounter) and allows custom crafted spells to be performed.

We are planning to make add-on mods to make the experience better. Something like more mobs, mod integration, new items, op techniques.

### Cultivation system

The idea is that as the player cultivates, he/she will progress through many levels, being each time harder to breakthrough and sometimes breaking though. I made a system based on what is most read on wuxia novels, but it still needs tweaking.

### Technique System

Cultivating isn't just sitting still and getting stronger. There are cultivation manuals and instructions to cultivate. In this mod they're called techniques.

Techniques are made by combining aspects and each aspect have one effect on both the cultivation speed and also the cultivator as well.
One example is if the cultivator goes a path of cultivating fire, he will get more resistant to it and also generate his own fire skills.

Aspects are gained in the most random ways as well as unlocking new ones from just getting better at another.

### Skills

Skills, or spells, are the manifestation of power of a cultivator, so he can perform miracles using his own energy.
Miracles are just a way of putting the supernatural because it can either heal people or kill people on the same lethality.

At the moment, Skills are just part of a technique aspect and are not custom yet.

### Professions

Professions are planned as to be sub systems of crafting and perhaps other activities as well.
They can be cultivated as well increasing the quality or count of yielded products.
The planned professions are:
- Alchemy: Create pills using mystical herbs that have unique effects like regenerating your energy, increasing your strength or improving your cultivation. This is somewhat similar to potion brewing in theory, but require more active thinking and acting.

- Forging: Create items using mundane or mystical materials that might have the most different effects.
